The most common languages that use object oriented programming are Java, C++, Python, PHP and JavaScript. These languages have the ability to create classes which are groups of functions and variables that work together to define what an object does.Objects in object oriented programming are created with classes which can contain data members and member functions or methods. Classes can be used to create new objects by instantiating them with specific values for their data members and then invoking their methods.",
